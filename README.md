# Dash Button HA
Home Automation system for the Amazon Dash Button on Node.

### Setup
This program uses [dash_button](https://github.com/ide/dash-button), a npm package by James Ide, to interact with the Amazon Dash Button.

Install dash_button:  
  
`npm install --save dash-button`

Babel JS compiler (optional):  
  
`npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-preset-es2017`

#### Babel Configurations
If Babel is used, set the preset transformation as ES2017:  
  
`echo '{ "presets": ["es2017"] }' > .babelrc`

### Retrieving the MAC Address of the Amazon Dash Button
The dash-button package includes a script that can easily retrieve the MAC Address of Amazon Dash Buttons sending DHCP requests or ARP probes.  
  
To run it, add a scan script to the `scripts` section of package.json:  
  
```JSON
"scripts": {
  "scan": "dash-button scan"
}

```    
  
And run it with sudo:  
  
`sudo npm run scan`
  
If the server and Dash button is connected to a specific network interface that might require additional configurations, specificy the interface explicitly in the command line:  
  
`sudo npm run scan -- --interface en1`

### Running Dash-Button-HA
With Babel:  
  
`./node_modules/.bin/babel-node index.js`
  
You can also configure `npm start` to execute `index.js` with Babel â€” to do so, add a start to the `Scripts` section of package.json:   
  
```JSON
"scripts": {
  "start": "./node_modules/.bin/babel-node index.js"
}
```  
  
#### Troubleshoot
If you see `Error: pcap_findalldevs didn't find any devs`, add `sudo` before `./node_modules/.bin/babel-node` and run again.
